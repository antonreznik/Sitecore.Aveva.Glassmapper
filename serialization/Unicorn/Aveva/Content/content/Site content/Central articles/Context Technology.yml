        <p>AVEVA's Information Management technology unlocks immense value from the <a href="#">Digital Asset</a> by providing access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time, to improve decision-making speed and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Context technology puts this rich information resource literally at the fingertips of the designer or engineer. Direct &lsquo;in-context&rsquo; retrieval of relevant content from the Digital Asset speeds up their decision-making, without having to leave their standard applications.</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="fancy">AVEVA E3D</a>, <a href="#" class="fancy">AVEVA Diagrams</a> and <a href="#">AVEVA Engineering</a> are the first products to benefit from this new technology, that embeds a multi-format document viewer to give them a window into the Digital Asset.</p>
