        <p>Based on the Digital Asset approach, AVEVA&rsquo;s software solutions blend tight application integration with a flexible, open framework to accommodate information from all sources, both AVEVA&rsquo;s and third-party. They support every stage of the asset life cycle.</p>
        <p>For even greater power, a number of solutions are integrated into solution suites for different stages of the asset life cycle. They all support the creation and use of a Digital Asset for increased project predictability or operational reliability.</p>

        <h2>INTEGRATED ENGINEERING &amp; DESIGN<img style="width: 200px; float: right; height: 170px; border: 0px solid;" alt="Digital Asset - Integrated Engineering &amp; Design solution" src="-/media/1CEE69D5FE8D46AFBD2CFBE3A1ED2D17.ashx?la=en"></h2>
        <p><strong>Digital Asset - Integrated Engineering &amp; Design solution</strong></p>
        <p>The Integrated Engineering &amp; Design (IE&amp;D) solution suite tightly integrates engineering, design and data capture applications for EPCs, Owner Operators and shipbuilders. It dramatically improves design and engineering process efficiency for major capital projects, as well as for asset modification and revamps.</p>
        <p>AVEVA&rsquo;s unique 'Compare&nbsp;&amp; Update' and 'Change Highlighting' functionalities enable the various project disciplines to easily and dynamically share design and engineering information at every phase in the process, helping to control the iterative design spiral in order to meet project schedules and improve the quality of deliverables.</p>
        <p>A typical IE&amp;D solution configuration might consist of the following integrated applications:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <tbody>
                <tr>

        <p>For shipbuilders an IE&amp;D solution can be configured with dedicated applications for their specialist needs. Any initial IE&amp;D deployment can be readily extended with additional self-integrating applications.</p>
